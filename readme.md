### Bonus Problem: **Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium)**

#### **Problem**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring.

#### **Solution:**

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
function longestPalindrome(s) {
    let start = 0, end = 0;
    function expandAroundCenter(left, right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let len1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i);
        let len2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1);
        let len = Math.max(len1, len2);
        if (len > end - start) {
            start = i - Math.floor((len - 1) / 2);
            end = i + Math.floor(len / 2);
        }
    }
    return s.slice(start, end + 1);
}
```

**Python:**
```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    def expandAroundCenter(left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return right - left - 1

    start, end = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        len1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i)
        len2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)
        length = max(len1, len2)
        if length > end - start:
            start = i - (length - 1) // 2
            end = i + length // 2
    return s[start:end + 1]
```

**Java:**
```java
public class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
            if (len > end - start) {
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;

            }
        }
        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }
}

### **Problem: Tower of Hanoi**

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and recursion. The objective is to move all the disks from one peg to another peg, subject to the following constraints:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time.**
2. **A disk can only be moved to the top of another peg if it is smaller than the disk currently on that peg.**
3. **There are three pegs and a number of disks.** Initially, all disks are stacked in increasing size on the first peg (smallest at the top).

#### **Problem Description**:

Given `n` disks and 3 rods (pegs), you are required to move the `n` disks from the source rod to the destination rod, using the auxiliary rod, with the minimum number of moves possible. 

**Your task is to write a function to return the list of moves to solve the puzzle.**

### **Function Signature:**

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n: int, source: str, destination: str, auxiliary: str) -> List[str]:
    pass
```

### **Input:**
- `n`: The number of disks (1 <= n <= 10).
- `source`: A character representing the source rod (e.g., "A").
- `destination`: A character representing the destination rod (e.g., "C").
- `auxiliary`: A character representing the auxiliary rod (e.g., "B").

### **Output:**
- A list of strings where each string represents a move. Each move is represented as "Move disk X from rod Y to rod Z".

---

### **Example:**

#### **Input:**
```python
tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B')
```

#### **Output:**
```python
[
    "Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C",
    "Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B",
    "Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B",
    "Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C",
    "Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A",
    "Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C",
    "Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C"
]
```

### **Explanation:**
- Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C.
- Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B.
- Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B.
- Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C.
- Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A.
- Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C.
- Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C.

---

### **Solution Approach:**

This problem can be solved using recursion. The idea is:
1. Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary using destination as a temporary holding area.
2. Move the `nth` disk (the largest disk) from source to destination.
3. Move the `n-1` disks from auxiliary to destination using source as a temporary holding area.

The base case for the recursion is when there's only one disk. For that, we can directly move the disk from source to destination.

---

### **Python Code Solution:**

```python
from typing import List

def tower_of_hanoi(n: int, source: str, destination: str, auxiliary: str) -> List[str]:
    moves = []
    if n == 1:
        moves.append(f"Move disk 1 from rod {source} to rod {destination}")
        return moves
    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as auxiliary
    moves += tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    moves.append(f"Move disk {n} from rod {source} to rod {destination}")
    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as auxiliary
    moves += tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)
    return moves
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(2^n)** because we are solving two subproblems of size `n-1` and making a constant amount of work for each disk movement.

### **Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the recursion stack.

### **Tower of Hanoi Solution**

#### **Java Solution:**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TowerOfHanoi {

    public static List<String> towerOfHanoi(int n, char source, char destination, char auxiliary) {
        List<String> moves = new ArrayList<>();
        solveHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary, moves);
        return moves;
    }

    private static void solveHanoi(int n, char source, char destination, char auxiliary, List<String> moves) {
        if (n == 1) {
            moves.add("Move disk 1 from rod " + source + " to rod " + destination);
            return;
        }
        solveHanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination, moves);
        moves.add("Move disk " + n + " from rod " + source + " to rod " + destination);
        solveHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source, moves);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;
        List<String> moves = towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B');
        for (String move : moves) {
            System.out.println(move);
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. We define a `towerOfHanoi` method that initializes the recursion.
2. The `solveHanoi` method is the recursive helper function that generates the moves.
3. We print out the moves in the `main` method for `n = 3` disks.

#### **Output:**
```
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
```

---

#### **JavaScript Solution:**

```javascript
function towerOfHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary) {
    const moves = [];
    solveHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary, moves);
    return moves;
}

function solveHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary, moves) {
    if (n === 1) {
        moves.push(`Move disk 1 from rod ${source} to rod ${destination}`);
        return;
    }
    solveHanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination, moves);
    moves.push(`Move disk ${n} from rod ${source} to rod ${destination}`);
    solveHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source, moves);
}

const n = 3;
const moves = towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B');
moves.forEach(move => console.log(move));
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. The `towerOfHanoi` function returns an array of moves.
2. The `solveHanoi` function is the recursive function that generates each move.
3. We use `console.log` to output the list of moves when called with `n = 3`.

#### **Output:**
```
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
```

---

### **Time Complexity (Both Java and JavaScript):**
- **O(2^n)**, where `n` is the number of disks.

### **Space Complexity (Both Java and JavaScript):**
- **O(n)** due to the recursion stack.

## Coding Questions


**Question 1:**

Given a string containing various characters, identify the binary substring whose decimal representation has the minimum degree (i.e., the fewest divisions by 2 until it becomes odd). Print the degree of this binary number. If no such binary substring exists, print -1.

**Function Description:**

Implement the function `printDegree()` that processes the input string to find the desired binary substring and outputs its degree. If no valid binary substring is found, the function should return -1.

**Example:**

For the input string `a1b0c101d`, the binary substrings are `0` and `101`.

- The decimal representation of `0` has an infinite degree since it can be divided by 2 indefinitely.

- The decimal representation of `101` is 5, which has a degree of 0 (since it's already odd).

Therefore, the function should return 0.

**Note:** The degree of zero is considered infinite because it can be divided by 2 infinitely many times.

<!-- ================================================================= -->

To solve the problem, we need to:

1. Identify the **binary substrings** in the input string.
2. Convert each binary substring to a **decimal** number.
3. Calculate the **degree** of each decimal number by counting how many times it can be divided by 2 until it becomes an odd number.
4. Return the **maximum degree** among all binary substrings.
5. If no binary substring exists, return `-1`.

### Plan:
- Use a regular expression to extract binary substrings (sequences of '0's and '1's).
- Convert each binary substring to decimal and calculate the degree.
- Track the maximum degree.

Here is the code implementing this solution:

```javascript
function printDegree(inputString) {
    var result = -1; // Default result if no binary substrings are found
    var binarySubstrings = inputString.match(/[01]+/g); // Match binary substrings
    
    if (binarySubstrings) {
        var maxDegree = -1;
        
        // Iterate through each binary substring
        for (var i = 0; i < binarySubstrings.length; i++) {
            var binaryString = binarySubstrings[i];
            var decimalValue = parseInt(binaryString, 2); // Convert binary to decimal
            
            // Calculate the degree of the decimal value
            var degree = 0;
            while (decimalValue % 2 === 0 && decimalValue !== 0) {
                degree++;
                decimalValue /= 2;
            }
            
            // Track the maximum degree
            if (degree > maxDegree) {
                maxDegree = degree;
            }
        }
        
        result = maxDegree;
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Test case
var inputString = "110110011"; // Example input
console.log(printDegree(inputString)); // Output the result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Regular Expression (`/[01]+/g`)**: This finds all binary substrings (sequences of '0's and '1's).
2. **`parseInt(binaryString, 2)`**: Converts the binary string to its decimal equivalent.
3. **Degree Calculation**: We divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly until it becomes odd, counting the number of divisions.
4. **Result**: The maximum degree across all binary substrings is tracked and returned.

### Example:
For the input string `110110011`, the binary substrings will be `['110110011']`. The degree of `110110011` (which is `435` in decimal) is calculated, and the result will be returned.

**Question 2:**

Given a string `S` consisting of lowercase English alphabets, determine if it is possible to split the string into one or more valid email addresses of the form `a@b`, where both `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only lowercase English letters.

- If such a split is possible, print the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in the entire string `S`.
- If no valid email address can be formed, print `-1`.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:**
   ```
   abcatgofgh
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   The string can be split into valid email addresses: `abc@atgofgh`. The total number of vowels in the string is 3 (`a`, `o`, `a`).

2. **Input:**
   ```
   aticatge
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   -1
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   The string cannot be split into valid email addresses of the form `a@b`.

**Function Description:**

Implement the function `validSolution(S)` that takes a string `S` as input and prints the number of vowels in the string if it can be split into valid email addresses, or `-1` if it cannot.

**Python Function Implementation:**

```python
def validSolution(S):
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    
    # Check if the string contains at least one '@' symbol
    if '@' not in S:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Split the string by '@' symbol
    parts = S.split('@')
    
    # Check if all parts are non-empty and contain only lowercase letters
    for part in parts:
        if not part.isalpha():
            print(-1)
            return
    
    # Count the number of vowels in the string
    vowel_count = sum(1 for char in S if char in vowels)
    
    print(vowel_count)

# Example usage:
validSolution("abcatgofgh")  # Output: 3
validSolution("aticatge")    # Output: -1
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Check for '@' Symbol:**
   The function first checks if the string contains at least one '@' symbol. If not, it prints `-1` and returns.

2. **Split the String:**
   The string is split into parts using the '@' symbol as the delimiter.

3. **Validate Each Part:**
   Each part resulting from the split is checked to ensure it is non-empty and contains only lowercase English letters. If any part fails this check, the function prints `-1` and returns.

4. **Count Vowels:**
   If all parts are valid, the function counts the number of vowels in the entire string and prints the count.

**Note:** This solution assumes that the input string should contain exactly one '@' symbol to form a valid email address. If multiple '@' symbols are allowed to form multiple email addresses, the function would need to be adjusted accordingly.
